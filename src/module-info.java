//Core Java -KeywordsAssignmentInstructions:Below you will find a 
//series of assignments that you will complete in this exercise. 
//You will need to create a new project folder for this task and 
//name it Java_Assignment_6_Keywords. You can use the default 
//settings when creating the new project.For each of the below
//assignments you will create new classesas specified below. 
//You can keep them in the default package.Most classes will NOT 
//declare a main() method except for the Application.java file 
//that you will write for a package. In your assignments, you will 
//execute the main() method of the Application.java file.
//
//Assignments
//1.Create a package com.mycompany.mainto place your files in.
//Create a class named StaticClass. Write a static method that 
//computes the sum of two floating point numbers. Use this 
//methodin an Applicationclass, to compute the sum of two numbers
//that you pass to your static method.
//2.Create a class named FinalClass and define an instance variable,
//myConstant. Use the finalkeyword to marktheinstance variable as 
//final. This makes it a constant. Add a statement to your 
//Application class to print the value of this constant.
//3.Write a class named AbstractClass and declare it abstract. It 
//should have an abstract method run(). Declare another class 
//ConcreteClass and it should extendAbstractClass. Implement the 
//run()method. In the Application class, add a statement to create
//an instance of ConcreteClass andthencall the run() method.
